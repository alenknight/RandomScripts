A series of scripts to help manage folders in directories.  these are primarily made for comyui - but they can pretty easily be readjusted for any windows folder directory.
these are in powershell for now.

USAGE
put any of these into directory (custom nodes) folder
go to the navigation bar at the top (windows) - type POWERSHELL 
  alternatively open powershell terminal and navigate to the folder directory
run the script (if you type part of the word and hit TAB, windows should cycle through all the matching scripts in your folder)

GitPullAll -
Basically cycles through every subdirectory and runs 'git pull'
